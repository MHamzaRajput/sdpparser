# Development
The SDPParser was developed using [Peg.js](http://pegjs.org), a parser generator for JavaScript. The [grammar syntax](http://pegjs.org/documentation) is very easy to learn and use. There is also an [online development tool](http://pegjs.org/online).

## Testing
The testing is done using Jasmine. To run the tests just run `npm test` or `jasmine`.
